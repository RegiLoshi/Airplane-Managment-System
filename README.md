# Introduction
This project was done for the Software Modelling And Design (SWE202) course. I worked in a team of 6 to design an Airline Ticket Booking Software. It was an intensive project where we had to deliver weekly reports according to the tasks given by our lecturers. Below, you will find the tasks we had to complete.

# Show The Stakeholders and Specify User Requirements
- **Decide on a list of the stakeholders:** Provide a short description of the project.
- **Specify high-level user requirements:** Include detailed user requirements.

# System Requirements
- **Extract from the user requirements 30 different system requirements.**
- **Describe each of them in detail using a table format.**

# ERD Diagram, BPMN Diagram, DFD Diagram
- **Build the ERD of the software.**
- **Create one BPMN diagram representing the main business operation.**
- **Build DFD Level 0, Level 1, and Level 2.**

# Activity Diagram, Use Case Diagram, State Diagram
- **Activity diagrams:** Create one for each use case (total of 30 activity diagrams).
- **Use Case Diagram:** Represent the whole system's use cases.
- **State Diagrams:** One for each interface and one for each user level.

# Class Diagram, Sequence Diagram, Collaboration Diagram, Interaction Diagram
- **Class Diagram:** One diagram representing the whole structure of the application.
- **Sequence Diagrams:** One for each activity diagram.
- **Collaboration Diagrams:** One for each sequence diagram.
- **Interaction Overview Diagram**

# Design Patterns
We chose and built the following design patterns with their class diagrams:
- **Facade Pattern**
- **Observer Pattern**
- **Strategy Pattern**
